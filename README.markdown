# tlaloc

Native cocoa based mac application for interfacing with rtorrent.

## Installation

Early days, compilation is necessary and not a lot else works but the torrent
list display.

Add ~/Library/Preferences/net.brokentrain.rtcontrol.plist and add a string with
key 'rtorrentRPCURL' and the value of your listening rtorrent xmlrpc uri.
