# Tlaloc

This application aims to be a native, cocoa-based mac application for
interacting with rtorrent over xmlrpc.

It's currently in very early stages of development.

## Installation

- Check out the downloads page and grab the latest build
- Configure rtorrent to actually use xmlrpc (see the official guide [here][1])
- Open the preferences panel and enter your rtorrent RPC URI (e.g. http://192.168.1.100/RPC2)

And optionally..

- Fill out the accessible destination path (assuming you can reach the download
directory) if you want launching to work, double clicking to open the files,
quick jump to destination folder, etc.
